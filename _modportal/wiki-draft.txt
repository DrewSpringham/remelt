== Introduction  == 
Welcome to the Inspecting-a-live-mod tutorial!

In this tutorial I will take you on an annotated tour of my mod
''Eradicator's Hand Crank Generator Deluxe''. That's a rather
long name so I'll often call it just HCG hereafter.
Hand Crank Generator is a fully functional mod that you can
download and play with right now! It has extensive
comments in the code to explain how and why it works.

This tutorial assumes that you already know how LUA works and that
you have have familiarized yourself with at least the basic concepts
of Factorio modding. On that basis it aims to provide a rough overview
on how real-life mods work. And shows you how to assemble the
theoretical concepts you have learned so far into a working whole.
If you want to give yourself a real challenge you can of course try to
read this without any prior knowledge and try to learn on-the-go.

First <code>settings.lua</code> shows creation of some basic setting prototypes. Then <code>data.lua</code> covers most basic operations like creating new item,
recipe, building and technology prototypes. And how to interact with 
prototypes of other mods. Finally in <code>control.lua</code> I explain how
to make custom behavior for buildings - namely how to make the
Hand Crank Generator produce power when the player presses a key on the keyboard.

You can read the files on the web on GitHub or download and extract
the mod locally to your harddrive.
