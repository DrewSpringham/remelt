# Where do i get a Hand Crank Generator (HCG)?

* You get one free HCG when you start a new game. If you're playing the default "Freeplay" scenario then you will have to **salvage it from the wreckage** of your crashed spaceship. In other scenarios it will be in your inventory. In the default configuration you can also research the recipe to make more HCGs.
