# Information

Hand Crank Generator - or HCG for short - implements a simple hotkey based
power production entity. It is intended to be a tutorial for modding beginners, 
but also fits well into modpacks with delayed electricity availability.

# Annecdotes

The mod is based on a joke on an IRC channel. At the time custom hotkeys were brand new! While being updated to every major factorio version the mod was mostly feature-complete in 1.x. Initially you would really get only a single HCG, with no way of building more, and with no way of picking it up again after placing it somewhere. It was already too damaged from the crash to be transported further! Or so says the lore. These restrictions confused many people into thinking the mod was broken. Starting from 2.0 the HCG behaves like any normal entity. You can craft as many as you want once the recipe is researched, and move it around to your hearts content. But you still get one free from the brand-new-but-already-destroyed Factorio 1.0 anniversary spaceship!
