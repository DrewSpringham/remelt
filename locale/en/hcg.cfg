hcg__run_time_in_seconds=A fully charged generator can sustain maximum output this many seconds (default: 5 minutes). [With all settings on default you get 5mins of 20kW for 10 seconds of cranking (30 cranks).]
hcg__run_time_per_crank_in_seconds=The generator will be charged this many seconds worth of full power output per crank (default: 10 seconds)
hcg__crank_delay_in_ticks=The generator can only be cranked once in this many ticks (default: 20 ticks = 0.3 seconds)
hcg__power_output_in_watts=The maximum power output of the generator in watts (default: 20 kiloWatts)
hcg__start_with_item_in_quickbar=Attempts to put the generator into the quickbar instead of the main inventory. In many scenarios this will fail and revert to putting it into the inventory. Other mods may also cause it to fail.

hcg__recipe_enabled=If additional generators can be crafted (default: off)
hcg__recipe_is_cheap=The default recipe requiers electric engines and is thus only available in mid-game. The easy recipe can be crafted right from the start. (default: off)
hcg__game_speed=(WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE IF UNSURE WHAT THIS DOES!)\nIf you play at a non-default speed adjust this to make the settings measured in seconds represent real-world seconds again. (default: 1)
